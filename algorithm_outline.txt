# Algorithm Outline (Pseudo-Code Summary)

1. Initialize random dot positions inside circular mask.
2. Generate figure mask (numeric pattern or path).
3. Assign figure and background LAB values with ΔE target difference.
4. Convert LAB → RGB and simulate color vision deficiencies.
5. Validate readability; regenerate until threshold met.
6. Export plate as PNG with ICC profile and metadata.

Note: This outline omits proprietary implementation details.
